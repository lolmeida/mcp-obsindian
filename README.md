# MCP server for Obsidian (TypeScript + Node.js)

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/lolmeida%2Fmcp-obsidian)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lolmeida/mcp-obsidian)

> A Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server that lets Claude (or any MCP-compatible LLM) interact with your Obsidian vault through the [**Local REST API**](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) community plugin – written in **TypeScript** and runnable with **npx**.

### Example prompts

```text
# Summarize the latest "architecture call" note
# (Claude will transparently call list_files_in_vault → get_file_contents)
Get the contents of the last "architecture call" note and summarize them.

# Find all mentions of Cosmos DB
Search for all files where "Azure CosmosDb" is mentioned and explain the context briefly.

# Create a summary note
Summarize yesterday's meeting and save it as "summaries/2025-04-24-meeting.md". Add a short intro suitable for e-mail.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Obsidian REST API key

There are two ways to pass the Obsidian API key to the server:

1. **Server config (recommended)** – pass it via the `env` field in your Claude (or other client) MCP-server declaration:

```jsonc
// claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lolmeida/mcp-obsidian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["lolmeida/mcp-obsidian@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your-obsidian-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

>[!NOTE]
> Use `lolmeida/mcp-obsidian@latest` to ensure you always run the most up to date version of the server.

2. Alternatively, you can use an **`.env` file**. Place the key in the `.env` you created above. Note it must be placed in the working directory where the MCP server is running.


### Environment variables

You can use the `.env.example` file as reference to create your own `.env` file.

```bash
OBSIDIAN_API_KEY=   # Obtain this from the plugin settings in Obsidian
OBSIDIAN_PROTOCOL=http
OBSIDIAN_HOST=localhost
OBSIDIAN_PORT=27123 # Port the Local REST API plugin is bound to
```

## 🛠 Development

### Running local version on Claude Desktop

After cloning this repo, you can update Claude's config to run your local version of the server instead of pulling from npm.
This is useful for quickly testing changes before publishing.

>[!NOTE]
>Keep in mind any changes you make on the code will only take effect after restarting the Claude Desktop app.

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` to point to your local version of the server:

```jsonc
// claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lolmeida/mcp-obsidian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["ts-node", "/path/to/repo/src/index.ts"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your-obsidian-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Note we use `npx ts-node` to run TypeScript files directly.

### Debugging

MCP servers talk over **stdio**, so normal debuggers aren't helpful.  
Use the **[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)**:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx ts-node /path/to/repo/src/index.ts
```

Open the URL it prints to step through requests (usually http://localhost:6274), inspect tool calls, and watch logs in real time.
